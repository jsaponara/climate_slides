Introduction

The data set contains ice core and firn air measurements of CO2, CH4 and N2O from Law Dome, East Antarctica.  The ice core and firn air data are grouped by compound and are given in the table 2006gl026152-ts01.txt  

Column 1: Sample type (eg. Ice core site: DE08, DE08-2 or DSS or firn air site: DSSW20K)
Column 2: Air/Gas compound age
Column 3: Concentration (ppm CO2, ppb CH4/N2O, based on the calibration scales maintained by CSIRO)
Column 4: CH4 concentration (ppb) adjusted from the scale maintained by CSIRO to the new NOAA04 scale. 


Measurement Uncertainties:
The 1-sigma measurement precision for the ice core samples is 4.1 ppb CH4, 1.1 ppm O2 and 6.5 ppb N2O.  Three types of tests were performed to ensure that the measured air sample composition has not been influenced by the measurement technique and realistically reflect past atmospheric composition using subsamples decanted from a standard air tank with known composition, these tests include:				 
(1) Analysis of a standard air samples decanted into either the flasks or traps; 
(2) analysis of standard air samples cryotrapped from a flask containing an ice core or air-free ice sample without crushing and
(3) analysis of standard air samples collected from the flask following the crushing of air-free ice samples. 											
Dating Uncertainties:
Air age spread is 10-12 years for DE08/-2 ice samples, 18-20 years for DSS ice samples and 5 years for DSSW20K firn air samples (Etheridge et al., 1996; 1998).
The dating uncertainty of air samples from DE08 and DE08 ice cores is less than 3 years (Etheridge et al., 1996; 1998; MacFarling Meure, 2004).
The dating uncertainty of air samples from DSS ice cores is less than +/- 5 years.  The DSS age dating has been revised based on new accumulation rates and temperatures (MacFarling Meure, 2004; van Ommen et al., 2004).  The dating of published DSS measurements (Etheridge et al., 1996; 1998) has been adjusted by less than 5 years under the new chronology.
