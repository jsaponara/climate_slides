earths energy budget

The Earth’s energy budget describes the
various kinds and amounts of energy that
enter and leave the Earth system. It includes
reflected by both radiative components (light and heat),
clouds & reflected by total outgoing that can be measured by CERES, and other
, , atmosphere lates) infrared radiation components like conduction, convection,
Laleeleal lato eae 77.0 22.9 PER) and evaporation which also transport heat
solar radiation from Earth’s surface. On average, and over
RI the long term, there is a balance at the top
of the atmosphere. The amount of energy
coming in (from the sun) is the same as the
amount going out (from reflection of sunlight
and from emission of infrared radiation).
