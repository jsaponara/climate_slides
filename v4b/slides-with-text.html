<section ><pre >let's talk climate

a 30-minute footprint-free introduction to basic concepts of
   climate change
followed by discussion
slides [will be!] available online at wetalkclimate.org</pre><aside class="notes"><pre ></pre></aside></section>
<section ><pre >this is not a talk about reducing ur carbon footprint

it's good to do, both for climate reasons and for health
   reasons
but there are other more imPORTant ways to fight climate
   change</pre><aside class="notes"><pre ></pre></aside></section>
<section ><pre >this talk is based on science

i'm actually a software developer, but i did get a BA in
   physics, MS in energy, and PhD in ecology LONG ago
but i'd love to hear about anything that's wrong or unclear
   in this talk.</pre><aside class="notes"><pre ></pre></aside></section>
<section ><pre >anything at all, interrupt me

i might defer it to the discussion or to email
but really interrupt, if u see someone raise their hand,
   call out!
anything you think of later, email me at
   john@wetalkclimate.org
youll see that address again later, and it's on the handout</pre><aside class="notes"><pre ></pre></aside></section>
<section ><pre >apols, i'll be showing lots of slides too briefly to absorb them

so that we can touch upon many topics
we can come back to any slide during the discussion to
   consider it more fully</pre><aside class="notes"><pre ></pre></aside></section>
<section ><pre >big points

- climate change is real
- climate change is serious
- climate change is stoppable
and i hope to convey some of the major concepts so you can
   more confidently spread the word.</pre><aside class="notes"><pre ></pre></aside></section>

<section ><pre >either way, our future is extreme

either an increasingly hellish climate and spending ever
   more on disaster relief, "resilience", and border
   security,
or an economy fundamentally reorganized, based on clean
   energy.
but together we can restore our climate--and doing it neednt
   be a chore...
maybe we can even USE climate change as a motivator to
   become healthier, to enjoy the fulfillment of working
   with others twd a common goal, and to engage with
   government as more active citizens.
it is urgent that we find ways to make these facets of life
   enJOYable...for the whole family!
so i hope you find a way to act.</pre><aside class="notes"><pre ></pre></aside></section>

<section ><section ><pre >is hydrogen the answer?

- hydrogen isnt an energy source, but rather a way to store
   energy.  it must be produced somehow.
- 80% of current hydrogen production is "gray", made from
   methane by a very dirty process that emits CO<sub>2</sub>.
- green hydrogen (via electrolysis) is very energy
   intensive, and thus expensive
- water is fully oxidized hydrogen, so it takes much energy
   to un-oxidize it via electrolysis or any technique
- expected future price of green hydrogen was recently
   revised upward
- green hydrogen competes for limited renewable energy, and
   the replacement energy today is likely from fossil fuels
- hydrogen used in fuel cells produces just water as a waste
   product
- but hydrogen that is burned produces NOx pollutants
- without tight regulations, hydrogen could be worse for
   climate than coal
    - by slowing methane conversion
    - by increasing water vapor in the stratosphere
- IRA includes billions for seven "hydrogen hubs" including
   a mid-Atlantic hub in NJ/PA/DE</pre><aside class="notes"><pre >--</pre></aside></section><section data-background-iframe=""><div style="font-size:0.5em">- without tight regulations, hydrogen could be worse for climate than coal</div><img class="r-stretch" data-src="imgs/acp-ocko-hydrogenClimateConseqs-22-9349-2022-avatar-web.png"></img><p style="font-size:0.5em"><a href="https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/22/9349/2022/">source</a><span style="padding:20px">       </span><a href="#/134">topics</a></p><aside class="notes"><p >- without tight regulations, hydrogen could be worse for climate than coal</p></aside></section></section>

proxies of past climate
- how we know about paleoclimate
greenhouse gases can worsen storms?  the causes of weather
EVs vs gas vehicles
- EVs are cleaner even if the electricity mix is very dirty
- upfront vs per-mile [operational] vs lifetime emissions
misinformation and disinformation
- we may be innocently misinformed due to disinformation
- disinformation is deliberate, and lavishly funded by
   industry
- and climate is especially inconvenient for those who
   oppose "world government"--or all government
- but we do not have the luxury for so many of us to
   continue being wrong about climate
- we need to genuinely listen and understand opposition
   views
- and learn to redirect that thinking in climate-positive
   ways
psychology of climate targets
- 1.5C vs sea level vs restore our atmosphere
industry smokescreens
- young forests
- "chemical recycling" of plastic; mass balance accounting

what is the current global mean temperature anomaly?
- no one really knows!  there's no standard measure
- normally use a moving window, so need to estimate future
   temps
- most folks use 1.2 or 1.3C as current global mean
   temperature anomaly, but nervously watch records being
   broken by record amounts
1.5C is arbitrary
- paris 2015 set goal of below 2C
- island nations pushed hard for 1.5
- but had we known earlier what wud happen now at 1.25ish,
   we'd hav set sub-1.2
directing hurricanes
- we have the technology to unleash vast energy from a
   single point via nuclear weapons
- but once that energy is released, we cannot direct the
   blast in any way
- hurricanes involves xx times the energy of a fusion bomb,
   distributed in a storm hundreds of miles across
- and if we cud somehow direct such a beast, it would
   require vast energy to appreciably alter the direction of
   that much mass

but major forests are becoming net sources of carbon
- amazon due to setting fires for beef and soybean
- boreal (canada and russia) due to wildfires and expanding
   pest range
our eastern forests are relatively stable (RIP Ash and
   Hemlock) but the Forest Service is seeking explicitly to
   reduce the amount of mature forest on public lands
even if all tropical land area was completely covered in
   tree plantations, it would sequester the equivalent of
   just 1.7 years of global emissions.
and we can't wait the decades it would take for those trees
   to grow to maturity.
often too few tree species are planted, reducing diversity,
   especially when converting grasslands to forest.

"carbon offsets", or forest "set-asides", is an unregulated

operators overstate likelihood of cutting forest,
sell the promise not to cut,
and may cut later anyway, or the forest may burn

<section ><section ><pre >carbon capture and storage ("CCS"): the Petra Nova example

"CCS", carbon capture and storage, would permanently store
   CO<sub>2</sub>, promising to produce "carbon-neutral oil"
so far, CCS is a trail of failed and failing projects,
   expensive and polluting, nowhere near the needed scale.
Petra Nova coal-fired generator in Texas
captures 90% of CO<sub>2</sub> when fully operational
but just 70% uptime
used 38 MW of uncaptured power to capture CO<sub>2</sub> from 240 MW
operates on just 6% of the site's 3700MW total generation
hasn't released data to allow independent verification
and leaks from upstream coal mine and downstream pipelines.
and the captured CO<sub>2</sub> is used to increase output from an oil
   well, more than negating the CO<sub>2</sub> stored.
cost $1billion
but several years into the project, the parent company sold
   its 50% stake for less than 1% of the project cost.
but Petra Nova is a success story among yet bigger failures
   in part because it hasn't been abandoned.</pre><aside class="notes"><pre >--</pre></aside></section><section data-background-iframe=""><div style="font-size:0.5em">Petra Nova coal-fired generator in Texas</div><img class="r-stretch" data-src="imgs/wikimedia-W.A._Parish_Generating_Plant_Aerial.jpg"></img><p style="font-size:0.5em"><a href="https://ieefa.org/resources/ill-fated-petra-nova-ccs-project-nrg-energy-throws-towel">source</a><span style="padding:20px">       </span><a href="#/134">topics</a></p><aside class="notes"><p >Petra Nova coal-fired generator in Texas</p></aside></section><section data-background-iframe=""><div style="font-size:0.5em">hasn't released data to allow independent verification</div><img class="r-stretch" data-src="imgs/wtc-ccs-petranova_math.png"></img><p style="font-size:0.5em"><a href="wtc">source</a><span style="padding:20px">       </span><a href="#/134">topics</a></p><aside class="notes"><p >hasn't released data to allow independent verification</p></aside></section><section data-background-iframe=""><div style="font-size:0.5em">and leaks from upstream coal mine and downstream pipelines.</div><img class="r-stretch" data-src="imgs/ieefa-CarbonCaptureAndMethaneInfographic_0.png"></img><p style="font-size:0.5em"><a href="https://ieefa.org/resources/carbon-captures-methane-problem">source</a><span style="padding:20px">       </span><a href="#/134">topics</a></p><aside class="notes"><p >and leaks from upstream coal mine and downstream pipelines.</p></aside></section></section>
<section ><section ><pre >CDR vs CCS (carbon capture and storage)

both generally inject CO<sub>2</sub> underground, but CCS operates
   where fossil fuels are burned.
most CCS projects inject CO<sub>2</sub> to extract more oil, to pay for
   the capture tech
but that oil, when burned, negates the CO<sub>2</sub> captured.
it's challenging to find a geology to hold CO<sub>2</sub>; one project
   unintentionally raised the ground nearly an inch,
   cracking buildings.
others have leaked, usually via abandoned wells
of which there are millions in the US.
since we can't inject just anywhere, pipelines are needed.
CDR at scale would require 65,000 miles of CO<sub>2</sub> pipelines in
   the US by 2050.
existing fossil fuel pipelines are too weak to hold CO<sub>2</sub>.
CO<sub>2</sub> pipeline rupture has sickened people and hindered gas-
   powered vehicles, even a mile from the rupture.
No company is prepared to underwrite the permanent storage
   that CCS projects promise, leaving that risk to
   taxpayers.</pre><aside class="notes"><pre >--</pre></aside></section><section data-background-iframe=""><div style="font-size:0.5em">both generally inject co2 underground, but CCS operates where fossil fuels are burned.</div><img class="r-stretch" data-src="imgs/shankariasParliament.com-ccs-and-cdr.jpg"></img><p style="font-size:0.5em"><a href="https://www.shankariasparliament.com/uploads/files/ccs-and-cdr.jpg">source</a><span style="padding:20px">       </span><a href="#/134">topics</a></p><aside class="notes"><p >both generally inject co2 underground, but CCS operates where fossil fuels are burned.</p></aside></section><section data-background-iframe=""><div style="font-size:0.5em">most CCS projects inject co2 to extract more oil, to pay for the capture tech</div><img class="r-stretch" data-src="imgs/cvdior.co.id-eor-ENHANCED-OIL-RECOVERY-EOR-METHODS-CONCEPTS-AND-MECHANISMS.png"></img><p style="font-size:0.5em"><a href="https://cvdior.co.id/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ENHANCED-OIL-RECOVERY-EOR-METHODS-CONCEPTS-AND-MECHANISMS.png">source</a><span style="padding:20px">       </span><a href="#/134">topics</a></p><aside class="notes"><p >most CCS projects inject co2 to extract more oil, to pay for the capture tech</p></aside></section><section data-background-iframe=""><div style="font-size:0.5em">it's challenging to find a geology to hold co2; one project unintentionally raised the ground nearly an inch, cracking buildings.</div><img class="r-stretch" data-src="imgs/earthdoc-surfaceUpliftFromCo2Storage.png"></img><p style="font-size:0.5em"><a href="https://www.earthdoc.org/content/papers/10.3997/2214-4609.20131984">source</a><span style="padding:20px">       </span><a href="#/134">topics</a></p><aside class="notes"><p >it's challenging to find a geology to hold co2; one project unintentionally raised the ground nearly an inch, cracking buildings.</p></aside></section><section data-background-iframe=""><div style="font-size:0.5em">others have leaked, usually via abandoned wells</div><img class="r-stretch" data-src="imgs/icn-orphanedWell-oilCityLouisiniana-GettyImages-1251484137.jpg"></img><p style="font-size:0.5em"><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.1c02234">source</a><span style="padding:20px">       </span><a href="#/134">topics</a></p><aside class="notes"><p >others have leaked, usually via abandoned wells</p></aside></section><section data-background-iframe=""><div style="font-size:0.5em">of which there are millions in the US.</div><img class="r-stretch" data-src="imgs/edf-us-orphanWells.png"></img><p style="font-size:0.5em"><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.1c02234">source</a><span style="padding:20px">       </span><a href="#/134">topics</a></p><aside class="notes"><p >of which there are millions in the US.</p></aside></section><section data-background-iframe=""><div style="font-size:0.5em">CDR at scale would require 65,000 miles of co2 pipelines in the US by 2050.</div><img class="r-stretch" data-src="imgs/netzeroamerica-summary-p43-pipelines.png"></img><p style="font-size:0.5em"><a href="https://netzeroamerica.princeton.edu/img/Princeton%20NZA%20FINAL%20REPORT%20SUMMARY%20(29Oct2021).pdf">source</a><span style="padding:20px">       </span><a href="#/134">topics</a></p><aside class="notes"><p >CDR at scale would require 65,000 miles of co2 pipelines in the US by 2050.</p></aside></section><section data-background-iframe=""><div style="font-size:0.5em">existing fossil fuel pipelines are too weak to hold co2.</div><img class="r-stretch" data-src="imgs/eeia-atScaleDeploymentOfCCUS-ch6-dontReuseGasPipelines.png"></img><p style="font-size:0.5em"><a href="https://www.eeia.org/post/CCUS-Pipeline-Transport-Meeting-the-Dual-Challenge.pdf">source</a><span style="padding:20px">       </span><a href="#/134">topics</a></p><aside class="notes"><p >existing fossil fuel pipelines are too weak to hold co2.</p></aside></section><section data-background-iframe=""><div style="font-size:0.5em">co2 pipeline rupture has sickened people and hindered gas-powered vehicles, even a mile from the rupture.</div><img class="r-stretch" data-src="imgs/huffpost-satartia-2fotos-warningSign-piplineRupture.png"></img><p style="font-size:0.5em"><a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/co2-pipeline-canceled">source</a><span style="padding:20px">       </span><a href="#/134">topics</a></p><aside class="notes"><p >co2 pipeline rupture has sickened people and hindered gas-powered vehicles, even a mile from the rupture.</p></aside></section></section>
<section ><section ><pre >key insight is that burning fossil fuels causes "climate pollution"

traditionally "pollution" is contaminants that can be

we think of gases as having negligible weight, but burning a

   about 20lbs of CO<sub>2</sub>, roughly a pound every mile we drive.
there is no way to get the energy from hydrocarbons without

- burning produces water, which must be removed to avoid

- the waste is triple the fuel weight

<section ><section ><pre >can one person make a difference?

most folks dont live in a democratic country, and maybe cant
   even express their opinion.
even among democracies, America is uniquely influential
   economically and militarily.
and of course many Americans don't have time or motivation
   for activism.
so your activism speaks louder than you may realize
and cutting emissions sooner impacts more of the coming
   decades
so we--right now--have great leverage.</pre><aside class="notes"><pre ></pre></aside></section></section>

ur presence at an event validates the organizer and hosting
   venue
ur presence validates others who look like u in some way but
   werent sure if they belonged there
ur presence inspires younger folks who wanna be like u
   someday
and u can become a conduit for folks u know to get involved
not to mention what ur actually learning or doing!</pre><aside class="notes"><pre ></pre></aside></section></section>

Even as battery demand surges, demand for mined minerals
   could peak within a decade, and maybe allow us to avoid
   mineral extraction altogether by 2050.
We need to extract an amount of minerals much less than our
   current yearly oil extraction--just once.
Electrification will enable us to transition from a linear

<section ><section ><pre >the sun is the energy source that drives earth's climate

we get .alot. of energy from the sun
earth gets sunlight equal to yearlyWorldEnergyUse every hour
in fact earth gets rid of most of the sun's energy
via reflecting from clouds and ice, and radiating infrared
you might think that getting rid of all of the sun's energy
   wud make earth a ball of ice,
but it wudnt, because the IR that earth radiates doesnt have
   a straight shot to outer space,
instead, it's absorbed and reradiated by those greenhouse
   gases in the atmosphere.
greenhouse gases cause IR energy to bounce around for awhile
   before it leaves.
it's this "IR pinball", along with the heat storage in ocean
   and land, that moderates earth's climate
global mean temperature is abt 60F, but if earth had no
   greenhouse gases to absorb IR, global mean temperature
   would be -18C=0F, so cold that the oceans would be frozen
   to the bottom.
so greenhouse gases are not bad--preindustrial greenhouse
   gases were in a goldilocks zone.</pre><aside class="notes"><pre ></pre></aside></section><section data-background-iframe=""><div style="font-size:0.5em">the sun is the energy source that drives earth's climate</div><img class="r-stretch" data-src="imgs/nasa-eei.jpg"></img><p style="font-size:0.5em"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_energy_budget">source</a><span style="padding:20px">       </span><a href="#/134">topics</a></p><aside class="notes"><p >the sun is the energy source that drives earth's climate</p></aside></section></section>
<section ><section ><pre >energy balance

as a result of this greenhouse gas "IR pinball", earth cud
   get rid of all the sun's energy and still be comfortable.
in fact, in order to remain at a constant temperature, earth
   .needs. to get rid of all the sun's energy
and that's just what happened during the preindustrial
   equilibrium, there was no net energy gain.
but now, as greenhouse gases rise, we are gaining energy
   from the sun: 0.6wpm2 in 2009, roughly 4
   totalGlobalNuclearWeaponYield's daily
at an increasing rate: 1.1wpm2 in 2019</pre><aside class="notes"><pre ></pre></aside></section><section data-background-iframe=""><div style="font-size:0.5em">energy balance</div><img class="r-stretch" data-src="imgs/nasa-eei.jpg"></img><p style="font-size:0.5em"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_energy_budget">source</a><span style="padding:20px">       </span><a href="#/134">topics</a></p><aside class="notes"><p >energy balance</p></aside></section></section>
